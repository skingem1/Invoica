# Welcome to Invoica

Invoica is the financial operating system for the agentic economy. We provide invoice middleware that sits between AI agents and payment networks, enabling autonomous invoicing, tax compliance, budget enforcement, and settlement detection.

## What is Invoica?

When AI agents make purchases using the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org), they need financial infrastructure to:

- **Generate invoices** automatically for every transaction
- **Calculate taxes** across multiple jurisdictions
- **Enforce budgets** so agents don't overspend
- **Detect settlements** on-chain with dual confirmation
- **Maintain ledgers** for full financial auditability

Invoica handles all of this as middleware — your agents send standard x402 payment requests, and Invoica intercepts them to add financial compliance automatically.

## Architecture Overview

Invoica operates as a transparent proxy between your AI agents and the x402 payment network:

```
AI Agent → Invoica Middleware → x402 Payment Network
                ↓
        Invoice Generated
        Tax Calculated
        Budget Checked
        Settlement Monitored
```
