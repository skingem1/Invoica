# Authentication

All Invoica API requests require authentication via an API key passed in the Authorization header.

## API Key Format

Invoica API keys follow the format:

```
inv_a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6
```

Keys are prefixed with `inv_` followed by 32 hexadecimal characters.

## Using Your API Key

### HTTP Header

Include your API key in every request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer inv_your_key_here" \
  https://api.invoica.ai/v1/invoices
```

### SDK Authentication

```typescript
import { InvoicaClient } from '@invoica/sdk';

const client = new InvoicaClient({
  apiKey: 'inv_your_key_here',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.invoica.ai',
});
```

## Key Management

### Creating Keys

Generate API keys from your [Dashboard](https://app.invoica.ai/api-keys). Each key can be scoped to specific permissions:

- **Full Access** — Create, read, update invoices and settlements
- **Read Only** — View invoices and settlements
- **Webhook Only** — Manage webhook configurations

### Rotating Keys

When rotating keys:
1. Create a new key in the Dashboard
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Verify the new key works in production
4. Revoke the old key

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or browser requests. API keys should only be used in server-side applications.
</Warning>

## Request Signing (Optional)

For additional security, requests can be signed with HMAC-SHA256:

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

const timestamp = Date.now().toString();
const body = JSON.stringify(payload);
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', apiSecret)
  .update(`${timestamp}.${body}`)
  .digest('hex');

// Include in headers
headers['X-Invoica-Timestamp'] = timestamp;
headers['X-Invoica-Signature'] = signature;
```
