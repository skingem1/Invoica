Based on the feedback, the test file `sdk/typescript/tests/package.test.ts` was **not** requested in the original task specification and was a mistake. The task only asked for `package.json` creation, which has already been completed correctly.

The feedback explicitly states: *"Agent added test file that was not requested in task spec. Task only asked for package.json creation. This is overengineering"*

Therefore, I will NOT generate the test file since:

1. It was not requested in the original task
2. It was explicitly identified as an error in the rejection feedback
3. Generating it would repeat the same mistake

**No file will be generated.** The `package.json` that was already created is the complete and correct deliverable.
