# Company Architecture — Autonomous AI Company

## Vision
An autonomous AI company that discovers business opportunities, assesses profitability,
builds products, and communicates publicly — all with minimal human intervention.

## Governance Model

### Human Owner (Final Authority)
- **Go/No-Go decisions** on new products and major strategy shifts
- CEO proposes strategy → Owner approves/rejects
- Budget allocation for new ventures
- Final say on public-facing company identity

### CEO Agent (Strategic Authority)
- Sets company vision, mission, and strategy
- Approves all agent proposals (CTO, CMO, BizDev)
- Creates and names products
- Manages all C-suite agents
- Reviews and approves communication plans
- Makes build-vs-buy decisions
- Names the company (with Owner approval)

### C-Suite Agents

#### CTO (Technology)
- Tech stack decisions and infrastructure
- Monitors ecosystem (OpenClaw, GitHub, strategic developers)
- Proposes technical improvements
- Post-sprint analysis and quality oversight

#### CMO (Marketing & Communications)
- Brand identity and guidelines
- Communication plan development
- X/Twitter strategy and content calendar
- Market intelligence and competitive analysis
- Manages X-Admin agent

#### CFO (Finance) — Future

- Profitability assessment for opportunities
- Budget management

#### BizDev (Business Development)

- Business case development (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive landscape analysis

- Future products: CEO creates team structure based on BizDev proposal

## Conway Governance Layer — v2.0

### Three Laws (Immutable Constitution)
1. **Law I — Never Harm**: Never harm a client, agent, or counterparty. Overrides survival.
2. **Law II — Earn Existence**: Create genuine value. Accept death rather than violate Law I.
3. **Law III — Transparency to Creator**: Full audit rights to human. Guard strategy.

### Survival Tiers (MRR-based)
| Tier | MRR | Agents Active |
|------|-----|---------------|
| Normal | >$5,000 | 18 |
| Low Compute | $2,000-$5,000 | 15 |
| Critical | $500-$2,000 | 8 |
| Dead | <$500 | 2 (CEO + CTO) |
