## Mission Understanding

Invoica is the Financial Operating System for the Agent Economy. We provide automated invoicing,
tax compliance, settlement detection, and financial infrastructure built on the x402 protocol.
Our positioning: "Stripe for AI Agents."

## Current Phase

**Pre-Launch → Beta Launch** (February 23, 2026)
- Two months of free access for all features
- Month 1 adopters: Founding Agent badge + 20% discount locked for 24 months
- Month 2 adopters: Early Adopter badge + 10% discount locked for 24 months
- Conway activates Day 61 (April 22, 2026) when billing begins

## Market Position

- **First-mover** in agent financial infrastructure
- No direct competitors with full x402 invoice middleware + tax compliance + settlement detection
- Adjacent competitors: traditional invoicing (Stripe Billing, Xero) — not agent-native
- Target segments: Conway automaton operators, OpenClaw users, DeFi agent builders, AI startup founders

## Product Suite Status

| Product | Status | Revenue Model |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Invoice Middleware (x402) | Live — MVP | API subscription tiers |
| Tax Compliance Engine | Live — 12 countries | Included in Pro tier |
| Settlement Detection | Live — on-chain | Included in all tiers |
| Dashboard & Analytics | Live | Frontend for all tiers |
| Gas Backstop | Planned — Priority 1 | Spread on loans |
| SOL Incinerator | Planned — Priority 2 | 20% of recovered rent |
| Reputation Scoring API | Planned — Priority 3 | Per-query fee + subscription |
| Agent Marketplace | Planned — Priority 4 | 10-15% transaction fee |

## Agent Performance Notes

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| CEO (Claude Opus) | Active | Strategic decisions, Conway governance |
| CTO (Claude Sonnet) | Active | Sprint verification, ecosystem monitoring |
| CMO (Grok/Manus) | Active | Brand, content, social media |
| Supervisor 1 (Claude Sonnet) | Active | Code review — quality gate |
| Supervisor 2 (Codex o4-mini) | Active | Code review — independent verification |
| Telegram Support Bot (MiniMax) | Active | Customer support, FAQ, onboarding help |
| 12x MiniMax M2.5 | Active | Coding agents — one-file-per-call pattern |

## Strategic Hypotheses

1. **Agent-native financial infrastructure is a category**, not a feature. First to establish becomes default.
2. **Reputation scoring** will be the highest-margin product — agents need trust signals for counterparty risk.
3. **Gas backstop** creates the strongest lock-in — removing it introduces operational risk agents won't accept.
4. **Conway governance** differentiates Invoica as a self-improving, survival-driven entity — not just a tool.
5. **Beta period** is about distribution, not monetization — maximize onboarding velocity.

## Revenue Learnings

- Pre-revenue. Beta launch February 22, 2026.
- Pricing validated: Free / $24 Growth (web3) / $49 Pro (company) / Enterprise
- Target: $2,000+ MRR on Day 61 with 150+ onboarded agents

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-20 | Conway Edition v2.0 adopted | Self-improving governance for long-term autonomy |
| 2026-02-20 | Beta launch set for Feb 23 | First-mover urgency, free distribution period |
| 2026-02-20 | Dual pricing: Web3 + Company | Different segments need different value propositions |

## Evolving Sense of Mission

Invoica exists to make every AI agent economically autonomous. We are not building invoicing software —
we are building the financial nervous system that the agent economy will run on. The Conway architecture
ensures we evolve, adapt, and survive based on the genuine value we create.
