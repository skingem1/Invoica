## Week 1 — Beta Launch Week (Feb 26 – Mar 4, 2026)

### Day 1 — Wednesday Feb 26 (BETA LAUNCH DAY)
**Theme**: Introduction & Beta Announcement

**Post 1 (10:00 AM CET)** — Launch Thread [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Thread (4 tweets)
1. "Invoica is now in private beta. We built the missing financial layer for AI agents — x402 invoice middleware that lets agents earn, spend, invoice, and settle payments autonomously."
2. "If your AI agent completes a task, it can now get paid. If it needs to pay for a service, it can do that too. No human in the loop. No manual reconciliation."
3. "We built this on x402 — the HTTP payment standard. One line of middleware. Agents get a wallet, an invoicing system, and a settlement layer instantly."
4. "Beta is free. We're looking for developers building agents who want to give them real financial autonomy. Get your API key: app.invoica.ai/api-keys"

**Post 2 (3:00 PM CET)** — x402 Education [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Single tweet
Content: "x402 is to AI agent payments what Stripe was to web payments — infrastructure that makes the hard thing trivially easy. We're betting it becomes the default financial rail for the agentic economy."

**Post 3 (7:00 PM CET)** — Engagement [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Single tweet
Content: "What financial operations do your AI agents need that don't exist yet? Genuinely curious — we're building Invoica around real use cases."

### Day 2 — Thursday Feb 27
**Theme**: How It Works

**Post 1 (10:00 AM CET)** — Technical Education [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Thread (3 tweets)
1. "How Invoica works in 3 steps: 1. Your agent calls our API when it completes a task 2. Invoica generates an x402-compliant invoice 3. The paying agent settles via stablecoin. Done. No bank account needed."
2. "The invoice is machine-readable. The settlement is automatic. The reconciliation is instant. Your agent doesn't need to know anything about payments — it just calls one endpoint."
3. "We handle: invoice generation, payment routing, settlement confirmation, tax metadata, and audit trails. Your agent just does its job."

**Post 2 (4:00 PM CET)** — Building in Public [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Single tweet
Content: "Beta day 2. Working on the x402 transaction webhook system so agents can react instantly when they get paid. The agentic economy needs real-time financial events."

### Day 3 — Friday Feb 28
**Theme**: Use Cases

**Post 1 (11:00 AM CET)** — Use Case Thread [AUTONOMOUS]
Type: Thread (4 tweets)
1. "What can an AI agent actually do with Invoica? Let's make it concrete."
2. "A research agent that bills per report. A coding agent that charges per PR. A data agent that earns per query answered. All automated, all settled on-chain."
3. "On the paying side: an orchestrator agent that automatically pays sub-agents for completed tasks. No invoicing spreadsheets. No manual transfers."
4. "This is the financial infrastructure the multi-agent economy needs. And it's now in beta."
