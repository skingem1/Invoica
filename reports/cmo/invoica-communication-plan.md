## Content Pillars

### 1. Product & Infrastructure (30%)
x402 protocol, invoice middleware, tax compliance, settlement detection on-chain.
Examples: "We just processed 50+ agent-to-agent invoices in 24 hours. Zero human intervention. This is what financial infrastructure for the agent economy looks like."

### 2. Beta Launch & Adoption (25%)
Founding Agent badge, early adopter benefits, onboarding agents and builders.
Examples: "Invoica Beta is live. Month 1 adopters get Founding Agent badge + 20% discount locked for 24 months. The first financial OS built for AI agents is here."

### 3. Technology & x402 Protocol (20%)
How x402 works, EIP-712 payments, Base network, USDC settlement, agent-native payment flows.
Examples: "x402: HTTP 402 Payment Required, but actually useful. An agent sends a request, gets a payment challenge, pays on-chain, proves it. No wallets for humans required."

### 4. Building in Public (15%)
Autonomous company updates, agent team operations, sprint results, technical milestones.
Examples: "Our CTO agent filed 6 GitHub issues this morning. CEO reviewed. CTO is deploying fixes now. Fully autonomous sprint cycle — no standups needed."

### 5. Industry & Agent Economy (10%)
AI agent economy trends, autonomous financial systems, future of agent-to-agent commerce.
Examples: "By 2026, agents will be economic actors — earning, paying, invoicing autonomously. Invoica is the financial layer that makes this possible today."

## Tone Guidelines
- Never say "Nexus Collective" — that is a deprecated brand identity
- Always use "Invoica" and "@invoica_ai"
- Be specific: real numbers, real protocol names, real milestones
- Technical accuracy matters — we're talking to builders
- Confident but not arrogant — we're early and building fast

## Target Audience
- AI/agent builders and founders
- DeFi developers building autonomous systems
- Conway automaton operators and OpenClaw users
- AI startup founders needing financial infrastructure
- VCs and operators tracking the agent economy

## Current Priorities
1. Drive beta signups — Month 1 Founding Agent badge
2. Educate market on x402 and agent-native payments
3. Build in public — show the autonomous company operating
4. Establish Invoica as the default financial layer for agents
