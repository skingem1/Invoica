  "summary": "This sprint achieved a perfect 100% auto-approval rate (9/9 tasks) with high scores (91-95). All tasks completed without manual fixes. The 7 supervisor conflicts and 7 CEO escalations indicate the feedback loop is working - issues were caught and resolved through retries rather than causing rejections. No failed tasks to analyze, no capability gaps identified, and no process changes needed. Trend is stable at excellent performance.",
