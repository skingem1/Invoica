  "summary": "Perfect sprint with 100% auto-approval rate and zero rejections. SDK-291 (Timer utilities) received a low initial score (46) but was successfully corrected on retry (SDK-292 scored 95). The 4 supervisor conflicts and 4 CEO escalations appear to be standard workflow steps during task generation, not execution failures. System performance is stable and improving.",
