  "summary": "This sprint achieved a perfect 100% auto-approval rate (9/9 tasks) with strong quality scores (92-95) and zero rejections. However, the 10 supervisor conflicts and 10 CEO escalations indicate process tension despite successful outcomes. The FE-481 truncation failure from the previous cycle was successfully resolved (FE-483: score 95). No new capability gaps or cost optimization opportunities identified — system operating optimally.",
