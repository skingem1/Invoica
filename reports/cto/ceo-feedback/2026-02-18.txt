# CTO Review — Week-9

## Analysis

The CTO reports **0 proposals** this cycle, which is unusual given:
- Week-9 achieved 100% task approval (7/7) with high scores (92-100)
- **Broken Grok intelligence feed** creates external monitoring gap
- Need to verify implementation status of previously approved proposals

This suggests either:
1. All systems are running optimally (unlikely with broken Grok feed)
2. CTO is missing capability gaps due to monitoring blind spots
3. Previous approved proposals may need implementation verification

## Decisions

## CEO Directive to CTO

Since no proposals were submitted despite the broken Grok intelligence feed, I'm issuing a **direct order** for tomorrow's scan:

1. **Fix Grok Intelligence**: The broken X/Twitter monitoring creates a blind spot in our OpenClaw ecosystem awareness. This is a **critical capability gap**.

2. **Verify Previous Approvals**: Check `approved-proposals.json` and confirm implementation status of all previously approved proposals.

3. **Deep Scan for Gaps**: With 100% task approval, we should be identifying optimization opportunities or new capabilities needed for Week-10.

**Expected Output**: Tomorrow's CTO scan should include at least one proposal addressing the Grok intelligence monitoring gap, plus status updates on previous approvals.

# Invoica Daily Report — January 27, 2025

## Sprint Progress
- Week-9: 7/7 tasks COMPLETED ✅ (100% approval rate)
- Task scores: 92-100 (excellent execution quality)
- No tasks rejected or pending

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.63 (7 tasks)
- Claude review calls: ~$0.35 (7 reviews)
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.15 (this review)
- Estimated total: ~$1.13

## Key Decisions Made
- No CTO proposals to review (unusual)
- Issued directive to fix broken Grok intelligence feed

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- No proposals submitted this cycle
- Concern: Broken Grok feed creates monitoring blind spot
- Directive issued for tomorrow's scan

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: [Need to check reports/cmo/]
- Latest strategy report: [Need to check reports/cmo/]
- Pending CMO proposals: [Need to check reports/cmo/proposals/]
- CMO decisions: None this cycle

## Blockers & Risks
- **Critical**: Grok intelligence feed broken — losing OpenClaw ecosystem signals
- **Monitoring gap**: May be missing optimization opportunities
- **Implementation verification**: Need status on previous approved proposals

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. CTO must propose fix for Grok intelligence monitoring
2. Verify implementation status of all approved proposals
3. Review CMO reports and any pending proposals
4. Plan Week-10 sprint based on current capabilities
```

**Status**: Week-9 execution was excellent, but monitoring gaps concern me. The broken Grok feed must be fixed immediately to maintain our competitive intelligence advantage.
