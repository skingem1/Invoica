      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "reasoning": "This is critical. router.ts and api-client.ts destruction in Week 18 required 45+ minutes of manual restoration and could have gone undetected. A simple line-count comparison is low-risk and would have caught both cases. The 50% threshold is conservative enough to avoid false positives on legitimate file replacements.",
      "conditions": [
        "Only apply to task types 'fix' and 'add' — full 'feature' rewrites are expected to change file size",
        "Log the warning but also show the original vs new line count in supervisor review context",
        "Threshold should be configurable (start at 50%, can adjust based on data)"

    {
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260215-005",
      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "reasoning": "Code fence contamination has persisted for 7 weeks (since Week 11). The current fix clearly doesn't work — 3/5 frontend files in Week 18 still had fences. FE-102 being auto-approved WITH fences is unacceptable. An aggressive strip + supervisor detection is the right dual approach.",
      "conditions": [
        "Fence stripping must happen BEFORE file is written to disk, not after",
        "Add a simple automated test: if any line in output matches /^\\s*```/, strip it",
        "Supervisor prompt must explicitly check: 'Does the file start with a markdown code fence?'"
      ],
      "priority": "immediate"
    },
    {
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260215-006",
      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "reasoning": "The data is clear: files >65 lines have ~10% success rate, files ≤65 lines have ~90%. sidebar.tsx failed identically in both Week 17 and Week 18. However, pre-splitting existing files is medium risk — it changes the component architecture. Implementation should be gradual.",
      "conditions": [
        "Start with sidebar.tsx only — it has failed 2 consecutive sprints, so it's the best test case",
        "Do NOT auto-split files — CTO/CEO should review the split plan before each sprint",
        "Add line count check to sprint design phase: warn if any task targets a file >65 lines",
        "Track success rate before/after split to validate the approach"
