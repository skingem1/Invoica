      "reasoning": "89% auto-approval dropping from 100% is concerning. SDK-101 failure is an anomaly that needs investigation - similar tasks passed with 91-92 scores. Understanding root cause prevents future regressions and maintains our quality standards.",
      "conditions": [
        "Document findings in learnings.md if new failure pattern identified",
        "Include specific remediation steps if systemic issue found"

      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260217-002",
      "reasoning": "3 supervisor conflicts (up from 0) indicates task boundary issues. Clearer scoping reduces retry cycles, saves LLM costs, and improves sprint velocity. Low risk with high value.",
      "conditions": [
        "Focus on task definition clarity, not supervisor prompt changes",

      "reasoning": "While test coverage is valuable, this adds complexity and cost without clear ROI data. SDK-101 failure may not have been caught by basic smoke tests if it was a truncation/import issue. Let's first understand the root cause from proposal 1 before adding test overhead.",
