      "reasoning": "Backed by clear evidence - SDK-217 failed 3x and learnings.md explicitly states 'If retry #2 fails, the task itself is probably too complex — decompose it'. This follows our own documented best practices.",

      "reasoning": "Critical gap identified - I approved CTO-20260219-001/002 to fix SDK-217, but the same issue persists. We need verification that approved changes actually get implemented, not just approved.",

      "reasoning": "Proactive prevention aligned with learnings.md patterns. The 'health check with Redis + DB + error types was too ambitious → rejected 3x' example shows we need early complexity detection, not just post-failure decomposition.",
