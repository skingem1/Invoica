      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-001",
      "reasoning": "89% escalation rate with 100% auto-approval is clear evidence of wasted CEO cycles. The severity threshold approach is sound - only escalate when supervisor score < 80 or flags critical issues. This saves both cost and my time for actual decision-making.",
      "conditions": [
        "Must test with next sprint and monitor for any increase in actual rejections",
        "Document the threshold logic clearly in orchestrator code",
        "Provide rollback mechanism if escalation rate drops too low"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "Update orchestrator to implement severity threshold filtering",
        "Supervisor agent continues normal scoring but escalations are filtered",
        "All agents continue normal workflow - no behavior changes needed"

    {
      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-002",
      "reasoning": "6-point score gap (89 vs 95) is significant and worth investigating. Understanding why SDK-260 scored lower helps improve task scoping and prevents future low scores. Low risk, high learning value.",
      "conditions": [
        "Document findings in learnings.md regardless of outcome",
        "If pattern found, propose specific task creation guideline updates",
        "Keep investigation scope narrow - don't over-analyze one data point"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "CTO to review SDK-260 materials and compare with higher-scoring tasks",
        "Update task creation guidelines if clear pattern emerges",
        "Share findings with all coding agents to improve future task quality"

    {
      "decision": "REJECTED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-003",
      "reasoning": "This proposal conflicts with Proposal 1 and adds unnecessary complexity. We're already implementing severity thresholds to reduce supervisor workload. Adding another pre-approval layer creates two filtering systems instead of one clean solution. The cost savings ($0.32/sprint) don't justify the added complexity.",
