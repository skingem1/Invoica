      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-001",
      "reasoning": "Evidence-based solution to real bottleneck. 12 CEO escalations for tasks that scored 92-98 and were ultimately approved proves the escalations were unnecessary. 70% reduction in escalations saves time and $0.20/sprint in costs with minimal risk.",
      "conditions": [
        "Must track escalation rate as KPI in weekly reports",
        "Include rollback mechanism if auto-resolution quality drops",
        "CEO escalation still required for security/architecture decisions"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "Update supervisor agent prompt with confidence thresholds and auto-resolvable conflict types",
        "Add escalation rate tracking to weekly sprint reports",

      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-002",
      "reasoning": "Low-risk, high-impact improvement. If MiniMax is predictably generating conflicts, better prompts should reduce them at source. A/B testing approach provides data to validate effectiveness.",
      "conditions": [
        "Run A/B test over exactly 2 sprints to measure impact",
        "Revert if conflict reduction is <25% or code quality drops",
        "Document results in learnings.md"

      "cascade_orders": [
        "Update all coding agent prompts with conflict prevention checklist",

      "decision": "REJECTED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-003",
      "reasoning": "Adding another agent increases complexity and costs without clear ROI. Proposals 1 and 2 should reduce conflicts by 70% and 50% respectively - that's already 85%+ improvement. If those don't work, then consider this agent. Also, pattern-matching auto-fixes could introduce subtle bugs.",
