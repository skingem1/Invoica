      "reasoning": "SDK-311 scoring 48 vs 93-95 for other tasks is a clear outlier indicating task complexity issues. This aligns with learnings.md patterns about complex tasks failing. Auto-flagging <60 scores prevents future quality issues.",
      "conditions": [
        "Document specific complexity factors that caused SDK-311 to fail",
        "Create task decomposition guidelines based on findings",
        "Implement scoring threshold alert in orchestrator"
      ],

      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-002",
      "reasoning": "4 supervisor conflicts + 4 CEO escalations despite 100% final approval indicates process inefficiency. Pre-validation can catch obvious issues before expensive Claude review cycles. Cost savings justify medium risk.",
      "conditions": [
        "Implement max 2 retries before forced decomposition (down from 5)",
        "Create pattern matching for common rejection types",
        "Monitor conflict reduction metrics for 2 sprints"

      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-003",
      "reasoning": "59% cost overrun ($3.17 vs $2.00 target) suggests previously approved optimizations aren't deployed. We can't optimize if we don't implement approved changes. This is accountability verification.",
      "conditions": [
        "Check approved-proposals.json implementation status immediately",
