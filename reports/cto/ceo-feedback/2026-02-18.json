      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-001",
      "reasoning": "Evidence-based solution to real problem. FE-481's score of 40 indicates clear truncation pattern. Auto-detection and decomposition will reduce manual intervention from 11% to <5%, saving both time and retry costs (~$0.50/sprint). Low risk with immediate rollback capability.",
      "conditions": [
        "Log all truncation events for 2 sprints to validate detection accuracy",
        "Set score threshold at exactly 50 as proposed",
        "Ensure decomposed sub-tasks maintain original requirements"

        "Update orchestrator to include truncation detection logic",

      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-002",
      "reasoning": "Critical process optimization. 5 conflicts + 5 escalations despite 89% approval suggests systemic inefficiency. Need data to determine if Supervisor is over-strict or CEO is over-escalating. 30% conflict reduction would save significant time and improve sprint velocity.",
      "conditions": [
        "Complete analysis within 1 sprint",
        "Categorize conflicts into: code_quality, architectural, trivial, security",
        "Provide specific calibration recommendations based on findings"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "CTO to analyze last 3 sprints of conflict logs immediately",

      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-003",
      "reasoning": "Proactive prevention is better than reactive fixes. Multi-variant components (horizontal+vertical dividers) clearly exceed MiniMax limits. Complexity scoring will prevent 1-2 rejections/month and improve first-pass success rate. Low risk, high value.",
      "conditions": [
        "Define complexity heuristics clearly: multi-variant, multi-state, multi-theme components",
