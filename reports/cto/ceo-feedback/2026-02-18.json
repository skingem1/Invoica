      "reasoning": "SDK-301 failure at score 35 caused 15 supervisor conflicts and 15 CEO escalations - clear evidence of cascade failure. Clipboard APIs are notoriously complex with browser quirks. Task decomposition follows proven pattern from learnings.md.",
      "conditions": [
        "Root cause analysis must include full supervisor rejection logs",
        "If decomposition is needed, create 3 separate tasks max",

      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260219-002",
      "reasoning": "Score 48 is dangerously low for auto-approval. Blind retries waste MiniMax calls and risk over-correction degradation. Quality threshold prevents low-quality code from shipping.",
      "conditions": [
        "Set threshold at score < 60 triggers human review",

      "reasoning": "Frontend consistency (93-98%) vs backend-core volatility (35-48%) suggests structural prompt differences. If frontend patterns are superior, we can eliminate the 11% rejection delta across all backend agents.",

        "Analysis must include specific prompt template comparisons",
