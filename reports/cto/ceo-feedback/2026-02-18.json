      "reasoning": "Strong evidence: 10 conflicts + 10 escalations with 100% eventual approval and scores 93-95 indicates supervisor is creating unnecessary friction. This is a clear process inefficiency that wastes CEO cycles and delays shipping.",
      "conditions": [
        "Must audit actual conflict cases first - don't just adjust thresholds blindly",
        "Implement gradual rollout: start with 92+ auto-approve, monitor for 3 days",
        "Maintain CEO escalation path for edge cases (security, architecture changes)"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "Update supervisor prompt to auto-approve scores 92+",
        "Document new escalation criteria in company-rules.md",

      "decision": "APPROVED",
      "proposal_id": "CTO-20260218-002",
      "reasoning": "Critical business need: $4.78 vs $2.00 budget (138% over) requires immediate visibility. Manual cost tracking delays corrective action. Real-time monitoring enables proactive cost control before budget blowouts.",
      "conditions": [
        "Start with simple logging - don't over-engineer the dashboard",
        "Alert threshold at 75% budget with CTO notification, 90% with CEO alert",
        "Include breakdown by agent/model to identify cost drivers",
        "Must not add >$0.10/sprint in monitoring overhead"
      ],
      "cascade_orders": [
        "Orchestrator: log all API calls with cost metadata",
        "All agents: be aware that cost monitoring is now active",
