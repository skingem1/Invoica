# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 7/9
- Tasks rejected: 20/27 (74% rejection rate — **CRITICAL ISSUE**)
- Tasks pending: 0

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.43
- Claude review calls: ~$1.08
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- Estimated total: ~$3.68

## Key Decisions Made
- **No CTO proposals** to review — system running in healthy steady state
- **Quality gate working**: High rejection rate indicates Supervisor is properly filtering poor code
- **Cost efficiency maintained**: $1.34/day operational cost within targets

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
No proposals this cycle. CTO reports excellent metrics: 0% rejection rate on approved tasks, OpenClaw ecosystem stable, 16-agent system performing well.

## CMO Activity
- No market watch reports this cycle
- No strategy reports this cycle
- Pending CMO proposals: 0

## Blockers & Risks
- **MAJOR CONCERN**: 74% task rejection rate suggests either:
  1. Agent prompts need refinement for better code quality
  2. Tasks are too complex/poorly scoped
  3. Model performance degradation
- Need to investigate root cause of high rejection pattern

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Priority 1**: Analyze rejection patterns — which agents, what types of failures
2. **Priority 2**: Review agent prompts for clarity and specificity
3. **Priority 3**: Consider task scoping adjustments to improve success rate

**Bottom Line**: System is cost-efficient and stable, but code quality issues are blocking productivity. Need immediate investigation into rejection root causes.
