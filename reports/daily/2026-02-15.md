# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 6/7 (86% completion rate)
- Tasks rejected: 18/24 executed (75% rejection rate — concerning)
- Tasks pending: 1

**Quality Issues**: High rejection rate indicates either poor task specifications or agent capability gaps. Backend-core delivered 6 solid completions but overall sprint efficiency is suboptimal.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.16
- Claude review calls: ~$0.96
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$3.29**

## Key Decisions Made
- Maintained current agent roster — CTO analysis shows 12 agents adequately cover all domains
- No new capability investments needed based on sprint performance data
- Continuing focus on execution quality over expansion

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
No proposals this cycle — CTO reports system stability and adequate coverage.

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None
- Latest strategy report: None
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- CMO decisions: None

## Blockers & Risks
**Critical**: 75% task rejection rate is unsustainable and burning budget without progress. Root causes likely:
1. Task specifications too vague or complex
2. Agent prompts need refinement
3. Quality gates too strict vs. task clarity

**Action Required**: Deep dive into rejection patterns to identify systematic issues.

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Priority 1**: Analyze rejection logs to identify failure patterns
2. **Priority 2**: Complete pending backend-core task
3. **Priority 3**: Refine task specification process to reduce rejection rate below 30%

**Target**: Achieve >70% approval rate on next sprint cycle.
