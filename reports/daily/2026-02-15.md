# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 0/7 ❌
- Tasks approved: 0 (despite 7/7 showing as "approved" in monitoring)
- Tasks rejected: 3 (SDK-060, BE-110, BE-111)
- **CRITICAL**: Zero executions despite approvals — pipeline failure

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.00 (no executions)
- Claude review calls: ~$0.00 (no executions)
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.15
- Estimated total: ~$0.15

## Key Decisions Made
- **CEO Directive Issued**: Critical pipeline failure escalation
- Required immediate investigation of orchestrator execution logs
- Mandated CTO proposal for pipeline restoration by next cycle
- Identified data inconsistency between monitoring systems

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **0 proposals submitted** — This is concerning given critical infrastructure failure
- CTO reported 100% approval rate but zero actual executions
- Missing expected proposals for pipeline fixes

## Blockers & Risks
- **CRITICAL**: Complete orchestration pipeline failure
- Data integrity issues between reporting systems
- PM2 cron jobs may not be executing
- Database connectivity potentially compromised
- Sprint velocity at zero — no deliverables being produced

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Manual pipeline audit** — investigate PM2 process status
2. **CTO prompt review** — ensure critical issues generate proposals
3. **Emergency task routing** — manual execution if orchestration remains broken
4. **Monitoring enhancement** — implement redundant failure detection

**Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE** — Immediate intervention required to restore development pipeline.
