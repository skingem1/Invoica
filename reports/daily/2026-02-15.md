# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 0
- Tasks pending: 0
- **Sprint Week-9: COMPLETE** — All frontend dashboard improvements and backend core enhancements delivered

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.09
- Claude review calls: ~$0.04
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$0.30**

## Key Decisions Made
- **No new CTO proposals** — Correctly focused on implementing three previously approved emergency fixes
- **Sprint completion validated** — All 9 tasks (FE-060 through BE-121) successfully delivered
- **Pipeline recovery monitoring** — CTO appropriately prioritizing implementation over new proposals

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
**No proposals this cycle** — CTO is demonstrating good judgment by focusing on implementing emergency fixes rather than proposing new changes during recovery phase. This is the correct approach.

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None this cycle
- Latest strategy report: None this cycle
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- CMO decisions: None

## Blockers & Risks
- **Pipeline instability** — Recent 65% rejection rate (CODE RED) being addressed by approved emergency fixes
- **OpenClaw version lag** — 2 versions behind (v2026.2.12 vs v2026.2.14), but updates are messaging-focused, not critical for our workflow
- **Cost monitoring** — Need to track if emergency fixes impact LLM usage patterns

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Monitor pipeline recovery** — Track rejection rates from emergency fix implementation
2. **Evaluate xAI (Grok) integration** — New model provider available in OpenClaw v2026.2.6+
3. **Plan next sprint** — Prepare Week-10 tasks once pipeline stability confirmed

**Status**: Recovery phase proceeding well. Team discipline is strong.
