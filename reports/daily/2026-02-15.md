- No infrastructure changes needed — system running in healthy steady state
- Resolved 13 supervisor conflicts through CEO escalation process

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **Zero proposals** — CTO correctly identified system is operating optimally
- Previous 74% rejection rate has been eliminated through improved task scoping
- 100% approval rate in recent sprints indicates mature orchestration

## CMO Activity
- No market watch reports this cycle
- No strategy reports this cycle
- No pending CMO proposals

## Blockers & Risks
- **High supervisor conflict rate** (13/36 tasks = 36%) suggests review criteria may need calibration
- Single frontend rejection needs investigation to prevent pattern

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Monitor supervisor conflict patterns for systematic issues
- Continue current sprint momentum with backend-core and frontend agents
- Prepare Week-10 sprint planning with focus on developer experience improvements
- Evaluate xAI (Grok) model integration for potential cost savings

**Status**: System healthy, strong delivery cadence maintained. 🎯
