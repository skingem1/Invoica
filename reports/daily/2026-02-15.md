# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 6/9
- Tasks rejected: 3/9 (all frontend failures)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Critical Issue**: 100% frontend failure rate (FE-100, FE-101, FE-103 all rejected) while backend-core achieved perfect 5/5 success. This is blocking all UI development.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.00 (no new tasks executed)
- Claude review calls: ~$0.00 (no reviews needed)
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- Estimated total: ~$0.17

## Key Decisions Made
**APPROVED CTO-20260216-001**: Emergency fix for frontend agent failure pattern
- Root cause: MiniMax oversimplifies complex frontend tasks after 2 rejections
- Solution: Strict task decomposition (<200 lines, single file) + complexity limits
- Immediate priority to unblock UI development

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **CTO-20260216-001** (process_change): APPROVED — Frontend agent systematic failure needs immediate fix. Evidence is solid: 3/3 rejections vs 5/5 backend success indicates model capability mismatch, not random failures.

## CMO Activity
- No market watch or strategy reports this cycle
- No pending CMO proposals

## Blockers & Risks
🚨 **Critical**: Frontend development completely blocked by MiniMax task complexity limits
- Risk: Cannot ship user-facing features until resolved
- Mitigation: Approved emergency fix with strict task decomposition rules

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Immediate**: Implement frontend agent prompt fixes with complexity limits
2. **Test**: Run one simple frontend task to verify fix works
3. **Resume**: Full sprint execution once frontend agent is stable

**Status**: Red — Core capability failure blocking product development.
