# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 3/6
- Tasks rejected: 31/34 (91% rejection rate)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Critical Issue**: Massive execution failure despite CTO reporting "excellent results." Only BE-100, BE-101, and FE-040 were actually completed. This disconnect between CTO assessment and reality indicates a serious monitoring gap.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$3.06
- Claude review calls: ~$1.36
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$4.59**

## Key Decisions Made
- **ESCALATION**: CTO monitoring system is fundamentally broken
- Immediate audit required of task execution pipeline
- Sprint Week-9 data appears corrupted or misreported

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- No proposals this cycle
- **Red Flag**: CTO claims 100% approval rate while actual data shows 91% rejection

## CMO Activity
- No reports available this cycle
- CMO pipeline appears inactive

## Blockers & Risks
- **CRITICAL**: Task execution system failing at scale (91% rejection rate)
- **HIGH**: CTO reporting false positives on sprint health
- **MEDIUM**: CMO communications pipeline down
- **LOW**: Cost efficiency good despite execution failures

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Emergency audit** of orchestration system and task validation
2. **Debug CTO monitoring** — why is it reporting success during failure?
3. **Restart CMO pipeline** and verify Manus AI connectivity
4. **Implement execution quality gates** to prevent future silent failures

**Owner Action Required**: This level of execution failure with false reporting suggests systemic issues that need immediate attention.
