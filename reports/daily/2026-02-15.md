# Invoica Daily Report — February 15, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 8/9
- Tasks rejected: 1 (SDK-101 failed with score 45)
- Tasks pending: 0
- Auto-approval rate: 89% (down from 100% last sprint)

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.98
- Claude review calls: ~$0.88
- Codex reviews: ~$0.66
- CEO escalations: ~$0.09
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$3.78** (well under $70 daily budget)

## Key Decisions Made
- **No CTO proposals** to review — system operating at peak efficiency
- Maintained current agent configuration (16 agents performing within parameters)
- Continued MiniMax M2.5 model routing for cost optimization

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** — CTO reports 0% rejection rate, 100% auto-approval, 14% budget utilization
- System stability indicates well-tuned architecture

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None this cycle
- Latest strategy report: None this cycle
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- CMO decisions: None

## Blockers & Risks
- **Quality concern**: 3 supervisor conflicts and 3 CEO escalations suggest some tasks hitting complexity boundaries
- **Anomaly**: SDK-101 rejection (simple utility, ~40 lines) needs investigation
- **Budget efficiency**: Only using 14% of daily budget — may indicate conservative task sizing

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Investigate SDK-101 failure root cause to prevent recurrence
- Monitor supervisor conflict patterns for task scoping improvements
- Continue sprint execution with stable 89% auto-approval rate
- Maintain cost discipline while scaling task complexity

**Status**: Healthy operations with minor quality tuning needed.
