# Countable Daily Report — February 14, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 5/5 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 7 (58% rejection rate — concerning)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Completed deliverables:**
- SDK-010a/b: TypeScript SDK foundation (backend-core)
- BC-030a/c: Core API enhancements (backend-core)
- BC-030b: Security middleware updates (security)

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.08
- Claude review calls: ~$0.48
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$1.73**

## Key Decisions Made
- Maintained focus on SDK development — critical for Q2 developer experience goals
- No architectural changes approved — letting recent test-runner agent and task complexity improvements stabilize

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- No proposals this cycle — CTO correctly identified insufficient new data to justify changes

## Blockers & Risks
- **High rejection rate (58%)** suggests task complexity or agent capability issues
- Previous sprint had 88% rejection rate — improvement but still concerning
- Need to monitor if test-runner agent and complexity rules are actually reducing rejections
- Risk: If rejection rates stay high, we're burning runway on failed work

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Monitor Week-5b sprint execution for rejection rate trends
- Continue SDK development momentum — this is our Q2 foundation
- Review agent performance data to identify if specific agents are struggling
- Consider task breakdown improvements if rejection patterns persist

**Status**: On track for Q2 developer experience goals, but execution efficiency needs attention.
