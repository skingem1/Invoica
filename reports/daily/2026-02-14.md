# Countable Daily Report — February 14, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 0/4
- Tasks rejected: 12/12 (100% rejection rate)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Critical Issue**: Complete task execution failure across all agents. All 12 task attempts were rejected by Supervisor, indicating fundamental quality or implementation problems.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.08
- Claude review calls: ~$0.48
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$1.73**

## Key Decisions Made
- **ESCALATION**: Declared sprint failure due to 100% rejection rate
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Initiated investigation into why all tasks (BC-004, BC-005, FE-002, SEC-002) failed quality gates
- **PROCESS REVIEW**: Supervisor quality standards may be misaligned with agent capabilities

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No CTO report submitted** — This is a process failure. CTO must provide technology monitoring report for CEO review.

## Blockers & Risks
- **CRITICAL**: Zero productive output despite $1.73 in compute costs
- **PROCESS BREAKDOWN**: Missing CTO technology monitoring (required daily)
- **QUALITY GATE ISSUE**: 100% rejection suggests either:
  - Supervisor standards too strict for MiniMax M2.5 capabilities
  - Agents producing fundamentally broken code
  - Prompt misalignment between coding agents and review agent

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Emergency sprint retrospective** — Analyze all 12 rejections to identify patterns
2. **Supervisor calibration** — Review quality standards vs. agent capabilities
3. **CTO accountability** — Require overdue technology monitoring report
4. **Agent prompt audit** — Ensure coding agents understand quality requirements
5. **Cost control** — Implement rejection limits to prevent wasteful spending

**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** — Company producing zero value while burning cash.
