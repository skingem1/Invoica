# Countable Daily Report — 2026-02-14

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 4/4 (100% completion rate)
- Tasks rejected: 0
- Tasks pending: 0
- Sprint status: **COMPLETE** ✅

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: $0.00 (no new tasks)
- Claude review calls: $0.00 (no reviews needed)
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.25
- Estimated total: ~$0.25

## Key Decisions Made
- **APPROVED** test-runner agent (CTO-20260214-001)
- Rationale: Evidence shows tests exist but aren't run pre-review, causing wasted Claude cycles
- Will save ~$0.13/failed-review by catching test failures with MiniMax (~$0.02) instead of Claude (~$0.15)

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- CTO-20260214-001: **APPROVED** — Add test-runner agent to catch test failures before supervisor review
- Conditions: 5min timeout, multi-runner support, isolated execution
- Priority: Next sprint implementation

## Blockers & Risks
- None identified. System operating at 100% efficiency.
- All agents performing optimally with zero rejections.

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Skills Agent to create test-runner agent specification
- Update orchestrator pipeline: coding → test-runner → supervisor
- Begin new sprint with enhanced quality gates
- Target: Maintain sub-$1/day operational costs while improving code quality

**Status**: Green across all metrics. Ready for next sprint execution.
