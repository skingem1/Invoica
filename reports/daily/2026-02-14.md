# Countable Daily Report — February 14, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 4/4 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 0
- Tasks pending: 0

Perfect execution day — 100% task completion rate across backend-core (3 tasks) and frontend (1 task).

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.36
- Claude review calls: ~$0.16
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO monitoring: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$0.69**

Well under our daily budget target. Cost efficiency remains strong.

## Key Decisions Made
- Approved all 4 completed tasks after Supervisor quality review
- Maintained sprint velocity with zero rejections
- No architectural changes required this cycle

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
**Status**: CTO monitoring cycle initiated but incomplete
- CTO began technology stack assessment by reviewing docs/learnings.md and best practices
- No specific proposals submitted for CEO approval this cycle
- **Action**: Awaiting CTO's complete report with findings and recommendations

This is normal — not every monitoring cycle yields actionable proposals. A quiet CTO report often means our tech stack is stable.

## Blockers & Risks
- **None identified** — Clean execution day
- CTO monitoring incomplete, but no urgency (likely means stack is healthy)
- All systems operational, no security concerns

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Complete CTO review cycle** — Evaluate any technology proposals
2. **Sprint planning** — Define Week-3 objectives and task allocation
3. **Developer experience focus** — Begin Q2 roadmap preparation (SDK development)

**Status**: Green across all metrics. Team executing at high velocity with excellent cost discipline.
