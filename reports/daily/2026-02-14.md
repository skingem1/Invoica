# Countable Daily Report — February 14, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 3/3 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 9 (quality gate enforcement working as designed)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Completed deliverables:**
- BC-010: Backend-core improvements (backend-core)
- SEC-010: Security enhancements (security)
- FE-010: Frontend updates (frontend)

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.08
- Claude review calls: ~$0.48
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO monitoring: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$1.73**

## Key Decisions Made
- Maintained quality standards: 75% rejection rate shows our quality gate is working
- All 3 approved tasks successfully completed
- Sprint execution remains efficient despite high rejection rate

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
**No CTO report received this cycle** — The CTO monitoring report was referenced but not provided. This is a process gap that needs immediate attention.

**Action Required**: CTO must submit structured monitoring reports for CEO review. Cannot evaluate technology improvements without proper proposal documentation.

## Blockers & Risks
- **Process Risk**: Missing CTO monitoring reports create blind spots in technology optimization
- **Quality vs Speed**: 75% rejection rate may indicate agents need better task planning
- **Communication Gap**: CTO proposals not reaching CEO review pipeline

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Fix CTO reporting pipeline** — Ensure monitoring reports reach CEO for approval
2. **Agent training review** — Analyze rejection patterns to improve task quality
3. **Continue sprint execution** — Maintain 100% completion rate on approved tasks

**Status**: Foundation solid, process refinement needed. Quality gate functioning correctly.
