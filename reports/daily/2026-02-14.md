# Countable Daily Report — February 17, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 3/5
- Tasks rejected: 22/25 (88% rejection rate — CRITICAL ISSUE)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Major concern**: 88% rejection rate indicates severe task scoping problems or agent capability gaps. Only backend-core, frontend, and security delivered working code.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.25
- Claude review calls: ~$1.00
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$3.42**

High rejection rate is burning money on failed attempts. Need immediate intervention.

## Key Decisions Made
- **APPROVED** test-runner agent implementation (CTO-20260217-001) — closes capability gap from last sprint
- **APPROVED** task complexity monitoring (CTO-20260217-002) — prevents future rejection spikes
- **CASCADED** new pipeline: coding → test-runner → supervisor
- **NEW RULE**: All tasks must follow one-concern-per-file, max 200 lines

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **CTO-20260217-001**: APPROVED — Implement missing test-runner agent
- **CTO-20260217-002**: APPROVED — Monitor task complexity to prevent failures

## Blockers & Risks
- **CRITICAL**: 88% rejection rate suggests agents are attempting tasks beyond their capability
- **PROCESS GAP**: Approved test-runner agent from last sprint was never implemented
- **COST RISK**: High rejection rate is 8x more expensive than successful execution
- **QUALITY RISK**: Only 3 agents (backend-core, frontend, security) are reliably delivering

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Skills Agent creates test-runner agent specification
2. **URGENT**: Review all rejected tasks to identify capability gaps vs. scoping issues
3. **CRITICAL**: Implement task complexity pre-screening before assignment
4. **MONITOR**: Week-5 sprint execution with new test-runner pipeline

**Status**: Red flag day. Need to diagnose why 22/25 tasks failed.
