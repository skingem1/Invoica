# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 0 (massive improvement from previous 77% rejection rate)
- Tasks pending: 0
- **Perfect sprint**: 100% auto-approval rate achieved

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.35
- Claude review calls: ~$0.60
- Codex reviews: ~$0.45
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.15
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$2.72**

## Key Decisions Made
- **Process validation**: Confirmed our task decomposition and one-file-per-call learnings are working
- **CMO proposal pending**: PROP-001 company name selection requires review (4 candidates: Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, plus partial 4th option)
- **Quality gates working**: Zero rejections indicates Supervisor review process is effective

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** — CTO correctly identified that current processes are stable and performing well
- This "zero proposal" cycle is actually positive intelligence showing process maturity

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None (Manus AI task failed)
- Latest strategy report: None (Manus AI task failed)
- **Pending CMO proposals: 1** (PROP-001 company name selection)
- CMO decisions: **REQUIRES REVIEW** — Name selection is blocking public communication

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO communication failure**: Manus AI tasks not executing, limiting market intelligence
- **Company name decision pending**: Blocking brand development and public presence
- **Supervisor conflicts**: 5 conflicts despite perfect approval rate suggests process tension

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Review and decide on PROP-001** company name candidates
2. **Investigate Manus AI CMO failures** — need reliable market intelligence
3. **Continue current sprint excellence** — don't break what's working
4. **Monitor conflict patterns** — understand why conflicts occur with perfect approvals
