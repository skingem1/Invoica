## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: No output from Manus task
- Latest strategy report: No output from Manus task
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- **Note**: CMO silence may indicate Manus AI connectivity issues

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO communication gap**: No reports received from Manus AI — investigate connectivity
- OpenClaw 2 versions behind (v2026.2.12 vs v2026.2.14) — low priority, messaging-focused updates
- High supervisor conflict rate (89%) but auto-resolving — monitor for efficiency impact

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Investigate CMO silence** — Check Manus AI integration status
2. **Continue current sprint velocity** — System performing optimally
3. **Monitor OpenClaw updates** — Evaluate xAI (Grok) model integration opportunity
