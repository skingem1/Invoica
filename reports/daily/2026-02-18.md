# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 3 during execution (33% rejection rate)
- Tasks pending: 0
- **Perfect final approval**: 100% auto-approved after supervisor review

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.08
- Claude review calls: ~$0.48
- Codex reviews: ~$0.36
- CEO escalations: ~$0.12
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$2.21** (59% over budget)

## Key Decisions Made
- **No CTO proposals approved** — CTO correctly focused on verifying 3 pending implementations rather than proposing new changes
- **Quality investigation required** — 47% execution rejection rate despite 100% final approval indicates process friction
- **Cost overrun flagged** — Need root cause analysis on 59% budget overrun

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- No proposals this cycle
- CTO waiting on implementation verification of 3 previously approved proposals:
  - Redis caching for tax calculations
  - Task complexity scoring system
  - Sprint data collection improvements

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None
- Latest strategy report: None  
- **Pending proposal**: PROP-001 Company name selection (5 candidates: Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, etc.)
- CMO decisions: **DEFERRED** — need to review name candidates

## Blockers & Risks
- **Quality gap**: High execution rejections suggest MiniMax output quality issues
- **Cost creep**: 59% overrun needs immediate investigation
- **Implementation lag**: 3 approved CTO proposals still pending verification

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Review CMO name proposal** — select company identity from 5 candidates
2. **Investigate cost overrun** — analyze where budget exceeded expectations
3. **Verify CTO implementations** — check status of 3 approved proposals
