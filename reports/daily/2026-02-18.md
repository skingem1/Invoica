# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 7/9
- Tasks rejected: 23/30 (77% rejection rate — concerning)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Quality Issues**: High rejection rate indicates either task complexity exceeding MiniMax M2.5 capabilities or supervisor calibration problems. Need investigation.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.70
- Claude review calls: ~$1.20
- Codex reviews: ~$0.90
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.21
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$5.18**

## Key Decisions Made
- **CTO Proposals**: 0 submitted — system reportedly operating optimally
- **CMO Product Proposal PROP-001**: Company name selection pending review (5 candidates: Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, plus 2 truncated)
- **Quality Gate Concern**: 77% rejection rate suggests either task complexity issues or supervisor miscalibration

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
No proposals this cycle. CTO reports 0% rejection rate and 100% approval, which contradicts actual sprint data showing 77% rejections. **Data inconsistency flagged for investigation.**

## CMO Activity
- Latest strategy report: No output from Manus task
- Pending CMO proposals: 1 (PROP-001 company name selection)
- CMO decisions: **DEFERRED** — need to review all 5 name candidates before approval

## Blockers & Risks
- **Critical**: 77% task rejection rate is unsustainable and expensive
- **Data inconsistency**: CTO reporting conflicts with actual sprint metrics
- **Company identity**: Still operating without official name, blocking public communications

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Investigate rejection rate spike** — analyze failed tasks SDK-268, FE-476, and others
2. **Review company name candidates** — make final decision on PROP-001
3. **Calibrate quality gates** — supervisor may be too strict or tasks too complex for MiniMax
