## CMO Activity

## Blockers & Risks
- **Process friction**: Every task triggered supervisor conflicts despite high quality

- CMO naming proposal needs review to unblock public communications

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Review CMO naming proposal** (PROP-001) — critical for brand identity
2. **Monitor supervisor escalation patterns** — may need recalibration
3. **Plan next sprint** — leverage current momentum with 100% completion rate

**Status**: Strong execution, minor process optimization needed.
