# Invoica Daily Report — 2026-02-18

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 8 (47% rejection rate during execution)
- Tasks pending: 0

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.53
- Claude review calls: ~$0.68
- Codex reviews: ~$0.51
- CEO escalations: ~$0.30
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.15
- **Estimated total: ~$3.17** (59% over $2.00 target)

## Key Decisions Made
- **APPROVED** response caching to reduce MiniMax calls by 30%
- **APPROVED** task complexity scoring to prevent high-rejection tasks
- **APPROVED** fix for CTO data source mismatch (was reporting 100% efficiency vs actual 69% rejection rate)
- **DEFERRED** CMO company name proposal PROP-001 pending further research

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **CTO-20260218-001** (caching): APPROVED — Clear ROI, low risk
- **CTO-20260218-002** (complexity scoring): APPROVED — Prevents wasted LLM calls
- **CTO-20260218-003** (fix CTO reporting): APPROVED — Critical blind spot

## Blockers & Risks
- **Cost overrun**: 59% above budget due to high rejection rates
- **Data quality**: CTO was blind to actual performance metrics
- **CMO naming**: Company identity still unresolved, blocking public communications
- **Process inefficiency**: 10 supervisor conflicts + 10 CEO escalations despite 100% final approval

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Implement response caching** (immediate cost savings)
2. **Fix CTO data sources** (accurate metrics for decisions)
3. **Review CMO name candidates** and make final company identity decision
4. **Start complexity scoring implementation** for next sprint

**Bottom line**: Perfect task completion but unsustainable costs. Three approved optimizations should bring us back under budget while maintaining quality.
