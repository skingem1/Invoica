## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 8/9
- Tasks rejected: 1 (FE-481 - Divider component, score 40)
- Tasks pending: 0

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$1.80
- Claude review calls: ~$0.80
- Codex reviews: ~$0.60
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.15
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05

## Key Decisions Made
- **CMO Proposal PROP-001 (Company Name)**: DEFERRED - Need to complete brand research first
- Maintained current architecture after CTO reported perfect system performance
- No changes to agent allocation or processes

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** - CTO correctly identified system is operating optimally
- CTO reported 100% approval rate (7/7 tasks), quality scores 92-100, ultra-low costs
- All 22 agents performing well with no capability gaps

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None this cycle
- Latest strategy report: No output from Manus task
- **Pending CMO proposal**: PROP-001 (Company Name Selection) - 5 candidates presented
- CMO decision: DEFERRED pending brand research completion

## Blockers & Risks
- **Brand identity blocker**: Company name selection deferred, blocking public communication
- **Task truncation pattern**: FE-481 failure suggests MiniMax output truncation issue
- **Supervisor conflicts**: 5 conflicts despite high approval rate indicates process tension

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Complete brand research** for company name decision
2. **Monitor truncation patterns** in frontend tasks
3. **Review supervisor conflict logs** to identify root cause
4. **Maintain current sprint velocity** - system performing well
