- System health: Excellent (100% sprint success, stable performance vs Week-9)
- OpenClaw status: 2 versions behind (v2026.2.12 → v2026.2.14), but updates are messaging-focused, not development-critical

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: No output from Manus task
- Latest strategy report: No output from Manus task

- **Issue**: CMO agent appears non-responsive — needs investigation

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO silence**: Marketing intelligence pipeline down, missing competitive signals
- **OpenClaw lag**: Minor version drift, but low priority given messaging focus of updates

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. Investigate CMO agent connectivity to Manus AI platform
2. Plan Week-10 sprint with continued focus on SDK development
3. Monitor 48-hour implementation verification tracking effectiveness
4. Assess if xAI (Grok) model integration offers cost savings
