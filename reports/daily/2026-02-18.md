## Cost Summary

## Key Decisions Made

- **CMO company naming proposal pending** — PROP-001 requires owner decision on public brand name
- **Maintained quality standards** — 100% auto-approval rate with dual supervisor conflicts resolved

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** — CTO reports peak efficiency with 23% cost savings
- OpenClaw v2026.2.14 available but assessed as non-critical
- System healthy, no intervention required

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None (Manus task failed)
- Latest strategy report: None (Manus task failed)
- **Pending CMO proposals: 1** — Company naming proposal (PROP-001) awaiting owner decision
- CMO decisions: DEFERRED (naming requires owner input)

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO Manus integration issues** — Strategy reports not generating
- **Company naming blocker** — Public communications stalled pending brand decision
- Minor: Grok feed not reviewed this cycle

## Tomorrow's Plan
- **Priority 1**: Owner decision on company name (PROP-001)
- **Priority 2**: Debug CMO Manus integration for market intelligence
- **Priority 3**: Continue SDK development momentum (backend-core + frontend agents performing excellently)
