# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 8/9 (89% success rate)
- Tasks rejected: 1 (SDK-217 circuit-breaker test — 3rd consecutive failure)
- Tasks pending: 0

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.00 (no new tasks executed)
- Claude review calls: ~$0.00 (no reviews needed)
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- Estimated total: ~$0.17

## Key Decisions Made
- **APPROVED** CTO-20260219-001: Verify implementation of previously approved SDK-217 fixes
- **APPROVED** CTO-20260219-002: Add implementation tracking to approved-proposals.json
- **New Company Rule**: All approved proposals must be tracked to completion with 48-hour verification

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- CTO-20260219-001: APPROVED — Critical gap in our approval-to-implementation process
- CTO-20260219-002: APPROVED — Essential tracking system to prevent future gaps

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: No output from Manus task
- Latest strategy report: No output from Manus task
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- CMO decisions: None

## Blockers & Risks
- **Critical**: SDK-217 circuit-breaker has failed 3x despite approved fixes — indicates our approval process has verification gaps
- **Process Risk**: Previously approved proposals (CTO-20260218-003/005) may not have been implemented
- **CMO Silence**: No reports from Manus AI — need to investigate

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Immediate**: Verify if CTO-20260218-003/005 were actually implemented
2. **Process Fix**: Implement approved-proposals.json tracking system
3. **Sprint Recovery**: Decompose SDK-217 into smaller tasks if fixes weren't applied
