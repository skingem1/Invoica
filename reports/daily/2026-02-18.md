# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 8/9
- Tasks rejected: 18 (high retry rate indicates quality issues)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Performance**: 89% completion rate with concerning rejection patterns. Frontend performed excellently (4/4 done), but backend-core showed inconsistency with multiple retries.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.34
- Claude review calls: ~$1.04
- Codex reviews: ~$0.78
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.45
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$4.78**

## Key Decisions Made
- **CMO Proposal PROP-001**: DEFERRED company name selection pending market research validation
- **CTO Proposals**: None submitted (system reported as operating efficiently)
- **Quality Concern**: 18 rejections from 26 attempts suggests agent calibration issues

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
No proposals this cycle. CTO reported 100% approval efficiency, but this conflicts with actual data showing 69% rejection rate. **Red flag**: CTO analysis may be missing quality degradation signals.

## CMO Activity
- Company name proposal submitted: 5 candidates (Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, etc.)
- Decision: DEFERRED pending domain availability and trademark research
- No market watch or strategy reports received

## Blockers & Risks
- **Quality degradation**: 18 rejections indicate possible agent drift or task complexity creep
- **CTO blind spot**: Efficiency report doesn't match actual performance metrics
- **Cost overrun**: $4.78 vs target $2.00/sprint (138% over budget)

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. Investigate backend-core rejection patterns and recalibrate if needed
2. Review CTO analysis methodology — may need prompt adjustment
3. Complete CMO name research with trademark/domain validation
4. Implement cost controls to return to budget targets
