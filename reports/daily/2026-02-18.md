# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 0 (perfect sprint!)
- Tasks pending: 0

**Quality**: 100% auto-approval rate with scores 92-95. Strong deliverables across SDK improvements (backend-core) and frontend components.

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$2.79
- Claude review calls: ~$1.24
- Codex reviews: ~$0.93
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.30
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$5.43**

## Key Decisions Made
- **No CTO proposals to review** — System operating at peak efficiency
- Confirmed current architecture needs no changes (100% approval rate validates our stack)
- Maintained cost discipline at ~$5.43/sprint (well under $500/month target)

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
**No proposals this cycle** — CTO correctly identified system is performing optimally. This restraint demonstrates good engineering judgment when quality is high and costs are low.

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None
- Latest strategy report: None  
- **Pending CMO proposal**: PROP-001 company name selection (5 candidates: Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, + 2 more)
- CMO decisions: **DEFERRED** — need to review full proposal first

## Blockers & Risks
- **Company name decision pending** — blocks public marketing efforts
- 10 supervisor conflicts indicate potential process tension despite successful outcomes
- Need to address why we had 22 rejections in task generation vs 0 in execution

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Review CMO name proposal** — decide on company rebrand from Countable
2. **Investigate task generation rejection pattern** — 22 rejections suggests planning inefficiency
3. **Continue current sprint momentum** — don't change what's working
