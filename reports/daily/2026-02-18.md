## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO silence**: Manus AI not producing scheduled reports — may need backup market intelligence

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Investigate CMO connectivity** — Ensure Manus AI pipeline is functional
2. **Continue sprint momentum** — Maintain 100% approval rate
3. **Monitor cost efficiency** — Keep under $2.50/sprint target
4. **Prepare Week-10 sprint planning** — Focus on product features over infrastructure

**Status**: System operating at peak efficiency. Ready for user growth phase.
