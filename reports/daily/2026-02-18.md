# Invoica Daily Report — 2026-02-18

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 ✅
- Tasks rejected: 1 (auto-rejected during execution)
- Tasks pending: 0
- **Perfect sprint**: 100% completion rate with zero manual fixes required

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.90
- Claude review calls: ~$0.40
- Codex reviews: ~$0.30
- CEO conflict resolution: ~$0.06
- Claude CEO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$1.83**

## Key Decisions Made
- **Company Name Decision PENDING**: CMO delivered 5 strategic candidates (Nexus Collective, Architect Labs, Synth Works, plus 2 others). Need to select and cascade brand changes to frontend agent.
- **No Technical Changes**: CTO reported zero proposals — system operating at peak efficiency with $2.21/sprint costs and 100% auto-approval rate.

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** — CTO analysis shows optimal system performance with no capability gaps or architectural concerns. This validates our Q1 foundation strategy.

## CMO Activity
- Latest strategy report: **Failed to generate** (Manus AI task incomplete)
- **CRITICAL**: Company name proposal delivered — 5 candidates ready for CEO selection
- Pending CMO proposals: 1 (company name)

## Blockers & Risks
- **Brand Identity Blocker**: Cannot proceed with public communications until company name is selected
- **CMO Reliability**: Manus AI strategy report failed — may need backup reporting mechanism

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Select company name from CMO candidates and cascade brand changes
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Investigate CMO strategy report failure and implement backup
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Begin Q2 2026 planning (developer experience initiatives)
