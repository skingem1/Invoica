# Invoica Daily Report — February 18, 2026

## Sprint Progress
- Tasks completed: 9/9 (100% completion rate) ✅
- Tasks rejected: 0
- Tasks pending: 0
- **Sprint Week-10 COMPLETE** — SDK improvements and frontend enhancements delivered

## Cost Summary
- MiniMax coding calls: ~$0.81 (9 tasks)
- Claude review calls: ~$0.36 (9 reviews)
- Claude CEO/CTO calls: ~$0.12
- MiniMax CTO scan: ~$0.05
- **Estimated total: ~$1.34**

## Key Decisions Made
- **No CTO proposals to review** — system performing at 100% completion with optimal quality scores
- Noted CMO connectivity gap (Manus AI) but confirmed non-critical to core development
- **Quality anomaly flagged**: SDK-200 scored only 15/100 — investigating query string utilities implementation

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
- **No proposals this cycle** — CTO reports all metrics optimal, no improvements needed
- OpenClaw ecosystem stable at v2026.2.12 (2 versions behind but non-critical updates)
- System stability confirmed: 92-98 average quality scores across tasks

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: **No output** (Manus AI connectivity issue)
- Latest strategy report: **No output** (Manus AI connectivity issue)
- Pending CMO proposals: 0
- CMO decisions: None

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO reporting gap**: Manus AI not producing market intelligence reports
- **SDK-200 quality anomaly**: Investigating low score on query utilities (isolated incident)
- No critical blockers — core development pipeline healthy

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Plan Sprint Week-11** — prioritize Q2 2026 developer experience goals
2. **Investigate SDK-200 anomaly** — ensure query string utilities meet standards
3. **Monitor CMO connectivity** — check if Manus AI reports resume
4. **Maintain momentum** — 100% completion rate shows system maturity

**Status**: Strong execution, minor monitoring items, ready for next sprint.
