## Key Decisions Made
- **CMO Proposal PROP-001**: Company naming research — **DEFERRED** pending CMO completion of candidate research via Manus AI
- No technical decisions required — zero CTO proposals submitted

## CTO Proposals Reviewed
**No proposals this cycle** — CTO reports system running optimally with no capability gaps or process issues identified. This is actually positive — indicates system maturity and stability.

## CMO Activity
- Latest market watch: None (Manus task incomplete)
- Latest strategy report: None (Manus task incomplete)

## Blockers & Risks
- **CMO Manus integration** not producing reports — may need troubleshooting

## Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Investigate CMO Manus connectivity** — ensure reports are generating
2. **Review completed CMO naming research** when available
3. **Continue SDK development momentum** — maintain 100% approval rate
4. **Monitor CTO daily scan** for any new optimization opportunities

**Status**: Green — System performing optimally, minor CMO integration issue to resolve.
