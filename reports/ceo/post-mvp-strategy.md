## CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

1. **Zero Customer Validation**: We built without paying customers
   - *Mitigation*: Aggressive Week 1 outreach, pivot-ready architecture

2. **AI Agent Market Immaturity**: Market may be smaller than projected
   - *Mitigation*: Expand to general developer tools if needed

3. **Technical Debt**: Rapid MVP development may have hidden issues
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing plan, CTO monitoring focus

4. **Pricing Model Assumptions**: 2.9% fees may be too high/low
   - *Mitigation*: CFO-led pricing optimization, A/B testing

**Bottom Line**: We have a complete product and low burn rate. Success depends on finding customers willing to pay. If we can't hit $500 MRR by March 15, we reassess strategy immediately.

**Next Action**: CFO hire and platform testing begin immediately. Launch proceeds as planned February 21.
